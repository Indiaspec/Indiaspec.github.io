	<p>This site contains potential solutions for systemic issues that India and other developing countries in the world are facing today. By leveraging the power of software such issues can be tackled and their impact can be significantly reduced. Citizens along with other eager contributors can take part in the development of the open source solution and then the government can fork the project. In case if the government takes the lead right from start then open source developers can contribute according to the project policies.</p>

          Stray animals are a challenge in India that many organizations and government departments are trying to address. But the reponse from such institutions is subject to inconsistencies because no one can know for certain the movement patterns and hiding spots of the stray animals. For the process to be perfect each citizen of the country must infrom the authorities as soon as they spot a stray animal with exact description and location. This is not reliable or efficient and the best way is to automate the process using ML based software. The flow diagram above shows a high level overview of the system. The 
          code repository can be found at this <a hre="https://github.com/Indiaspec/StrayAnimalMonitor" target="_blank">location</a>. And the technology used for implementation can be from any framework as long as it is widely accepted and has large open source support.

          Garbage management is an enormous challenge for most of the developing countries today. The variability of garbage location and the frequency at which streets are littered are not predictable at all. Even if they are predictable to a certain degree then collecting garbage at the same frequency will be expensive. If governtments have information on where garbage is being accumulated on a daily basis then they can better plan for garbage removal or even private compaines can claim the garbage for further processing. Using Android app to detect garbage even the well known roads along with the narrowest streets can be scanned on a daily basis.  The garbage information can be showed with a map on a web portal. Similarly the same Android app can be used to detect potholes on the road which can be shown on a web portal along with a map. This way contractors can bid on fixing the roads which will be transparent to the voters as well.
