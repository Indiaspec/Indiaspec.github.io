	<p>This site contains potential solutions for systemic issues that India and other developing countries in the world are facing today. By leveraging the power of software such issues can be tackled and their impact can be significantly reduced. Citizens along with other eager contributors can take part in the development of the open source solution and then the government can fork the project. In case if the government takes the lead right from start then open source developers can contribute according to the project policies.</p>

          Stray animals are a challenge in India that many organizations and government departments are trying to address. But the reponse from such institutions is subject to inconsistencies because no one can know for certain the movement patterns and hiding spots of the stray animals. For the process to be perfect each citizen of the country must infrom the authorities as soon as they spot a stray animal with exact description and location. This is not reliable or efficient and the best way is to automate the process using ML based software. The flow diagram above shows a high level overview of the system. The 
          code repository can be found at this location. And the technology used for implementation can be from any framework as long as it is widely accepted and has large open source support.
