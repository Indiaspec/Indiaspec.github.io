	<p>This site contains potential solutions for systemic issues that India and other developing countries in the world face today. By leveraging the power of software such issues can be tackled and their impact can be significantly reduced. Citizens along with other eager contributors can take part in the development of the open source solution and then if needed the government can fork the project. In the case where government can take the lead right from start then open source developers can contribute as per the project policies.</p>
